    <p>Let's learn more <em>HTML</em>...</p>
    <p>HTML entities are for writing html elements without it turning into code. For example if you want to write html in brackets you can do it by using &lt;HTML&gt;. The lt and gt stand for less than and greater than. &copy; makes the copyright symbol. "&_nbsp;"" but without the"_" will create a Non-Breaking-Space between two words. It's good for when there is a break at the end of a line. </p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>CSS stands for cascading style sheets...</p>
    <!-- "em" emphasizes content in html documents for search engines, not styling. For styling use css and don't rely on "em" to do it for you, even if some browsers put it in italics. "strong" is used in a similar manner as "em"-->
